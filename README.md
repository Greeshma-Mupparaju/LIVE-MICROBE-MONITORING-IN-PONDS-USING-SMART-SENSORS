# LIVE-MICROBE-MONITORING-IN-PONDS-USING-SMART-SENSORS

The main purpose of this system is to provide real-time monitoring and analysis of microbial activity in pond water by utilizing intelligent sensor technology. Presence
of microbials is one of the key parameters of water quality because specific bacteria and microbes can indicate contamination, disease hazard, or imbalance in the ecosystem. Early discovery of microbial alteration will prevent waterborne diseases,enhance aquatic life sustainability, and maximize water management strategies.The system will deliver real-time information to a cloud platform, which allows for remote monitoring and real-time notification once microbial activity exceeds safety thresholds. Automated water quality monitoring will enable the project to be more efficient, lower the manual testing volume, and provide room for proactive decisionmaking on aquaculture, agriculture, and conservation of the environment.This technology integrates advanced IoT-based sensors capable of sensing microbial shifts and reporting wirelessly in real-time for monitoring. The system provides real-time data, which is depicted via a smart dashboard, thereby facilitating monitoring trends and immediate corrective action. Monitoring process automation through this technology negates manual testing, reduces response time, and offers better water quality management.
